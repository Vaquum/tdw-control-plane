-- One OHLCV bar per {bucket_seconds:UInt32} bucket of the UTC span that runs
-- back {days:UInt32} whole days from midnight opening {through_day:Date},
-- rolled up from the 1m origo.binance_spot_klines projection. The span ends
-- where {through_day:Date} begins, so the history composes with that day's
-- own briefing feed file without overlapping it.
--
-- bar_start is declared as UTC epoch seconds (toUnixTimestamp) so the
-- history's time representation is fixed by this query, not inherited from
-- the server's Arrow serialization of DateTime. The bar grid is anchored to
-- span_start, which subtractDays puts on a midnight, and both published
-- bucket sizes (900 and 86400) divide a day: every bar in the span therefore
-- lands on the same midnight-aligned grid, and no bar straddles a day
-- boundary. Anchoring to the window rather than the raw epoch keeps window
-- and grid aligned whatever timezone the server resolves the naive
-- datetimes in.
--
-- source_minutes counts distinct 1m rows and source_rows all 1m rows behind
-- each bar, so the caller can refuse a short or duplicated bar instead of
-- publishing it.
