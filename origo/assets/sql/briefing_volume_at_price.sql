-- Measured volume-at-price for the UTC day {day:Date}: every trade at its own
-- price, split by taker side. Quantities are summed as integer satoshis
-- (1e-8 BTC, exact for Binance quantities of at most 8 decimals) and
-- total_sats is formed as the sum of the two sides rather than counted a
-- third time, so buy + sell = total holds exactly.
-- is_buyer_maker = 1 means the resting order bought, so the taker sold.
