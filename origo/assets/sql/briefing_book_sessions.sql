-- 8-hour session aggregates (00-08, 08-16, 16-24 of the day) of the depth20
-- 1m book for the UTC day {day:Date}. session_start is declared as UTC epoch
-- seconds (toUnixTimestamp) so the feed's time representation is fixed by
-- this query, not inherited from the server's Arrow serialization of
-- DateTime. The session grid is anchored to the day window itself, so window
-- and grid stay aligned whatever timezone the server resolves the naive
-- datetimes in. minutes counts the 1m rows behind each session so a thinly
-- covered session is visible instead of passing as a quiet one.
