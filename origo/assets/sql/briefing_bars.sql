-- One OHLCV bar per {bucket_seconds:UInt32} bucket of the UTC day {day:Date},
-- rolled up from the 1m origo.binance_spot_klines projection. bar_start is
-- declared as UTC epoch seconds (toUnixTimestamp) so the feed's time
-- representation is fixed by this query, not inherited from the server's
-- Arrow serialization of DateTime. The bar grid is anchored to the day
-- window itself rather than to the raw epoch, so window and grid stay
-- aligned whatever timezone the server resolves the naive datetimes in.
-- source_minutes counts distinct 1m rows and source_rows all 1m rows behind
-- each bar, so the caller can refuse a short or duplicated bar instead of
-- publishing it.
