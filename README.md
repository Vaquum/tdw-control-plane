# Origo — Data layer

*Event-sourced Bitcoin market data platform that turns raw Binance archives into checksum-verified trade tables, rebuildable bar projections, and replayable research datasets.*

Origo ingests Binance BTCUSDT market data into ClickHouse under Dagster orchestration, records every ingested source file in a checksum ledger, and rebuilds every derived table deterministically from that raw record. The Dagster deployment in this repository is Origo's control plane — the term names that orchestration component, not the project. The project evolves from tdw-control-plane, this repository's original identity.

## What Origo Is Not

Origo is not:

- a trade execution system
- a signal research or backtesting engine
- a multi-exchange market data vendor

In the wider Vaquum architecture, Origo sits upstream as the data layer. Limen consumes its outputs downstream as the research engine, and Nexus, Praxis, and Veritas sit further downstream for decisioning, execution, and oversight.

## Capabilities

- Checksum-verified ingestion of Binance BTCUSDT daily trade archives, spot (from 2017-08-17) and USDT-M futures (from 2019-09-08)
- Ingestion ledgers recording source file, SHA-256 checksums, row counts, Dagster run id, and status for every loaded day
- Atomic daily partition writes through a count-verified staging table promoted with `MOVE PARTITION`
- Rebuildable projections from the raw trade record: 1-minute klines plus dollar, volume, tick, and dollar-imbalance bars
- Aligned 1-minute table refreshed from both the spot and futures markets
- Rolling `_latest` tables refreshed every minute to cover the span between the last daily load and the latest closed minute
- Binance spot order-book depth snapshots (20- and 200-level) with 1-minute projections and per-minute reconciliation
- Hourly ledger-driven gap repair for the spot and futures daily pipelines
- Hugging Face publishing of twelve kline datasets: six time intervals and six dollar-bar sizes
- Local monthly Parquet mirror of the twelve kline series, refreshed every minute, with a versioned mmap-ready Arrow bar store rebuilt from it
- Ratcheted CI gates on every PR: strict pyright typing, fail-loud (no silent fallbacks), Conventional Commits, and version plus CHANGELOG trails
- Automatic production deploy of merged `main` through GitHub Actions

## First Backfill

The first runnable path is the local Docker Compose stack: create the ClickHouse tables, backfill one day of the spot pipeline, and read it back through the query module.

1. Clone the repository and set the one required secret:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vaquum/Origo.git
cd Origo
export CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD=<choose-a-password>
```

Supported runtime: the containers run Python 3.11 (`python:3.11.12`) and the package requires Python `>=3.11`; the host needs Docker with Compose. `CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD` is the only variable without a default — `CLICKHOUSE_HOST`, `CLICKHOUSE_PORT`, `CLICKHOUSE_USER`, and `CLICKHOUSE_DATABASE` default to the in-network values (`clickhouse`, `9000` native / `8123` HTTP, `default`, `origo`). `HF_TOKEN` and `HUGGINGFACE_DATASET_REPO_ID` are needed only for Hugging Face publishing, and the `BINANCE_SPOT_DEPTH20_*` / `BINANCE_SPOT_DEPTH200_*` pairs only for the live depth collectors; `docker-compose.deploy.yml` requires them all, the local `docker-compose.yml` does not. The local compose file passes `CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD` only to the ClickHouse server, so the commands below inject it into the Dagster container with `-e`.

1. Start the stack:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

1. Create the database and tables:

```bash
docker compose exec -e CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD dagster \
  dagster asset materialize -m origo.definitions \
  --select "create_origo_database,create_binance_daily_spot_trades_table_origo,create_binance_spot_klines_table_origo,create_binance_spot_dollar_klines_table_origo,create_binance_spot_volume_klines_table_origo,create_binance_spot_tick_klines_table_origo,create_binance_spot_dollar_imbalance_klines_table_origo,create_aligned_1m_exchange_table_origo,create_binance_spot_latest_tables_origo"
```

1. Backfill one day of the spot pipeline — raw trades, every bar projection, and the aligned table:

```bash
docker compose exec -e CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD dagster \
  dagster job backfill -j refresh_binance_spot_data_source_job \
  --partitions 2024-01-02 --noprompt
```

1. Read the day back through the query module:

```bash
docker compose exec -e CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD dagster python -c "
from origo.query.binance_spot_kline_rollups import dollar_month, time_month
print(time_month(interval_minutes=60, year=2024, month=1))
print(dollar_month(ratio=15, year=2024, month=1))
"
```

`time_month` rolls the 1-minute projection up to any minute interval, and `dollar_month` rolls the 1M-dollar bar base up by an integer ratio. Beyond the quickstart, every job, schedule, and sensor is defined in `origo/definitions.py` and can be launched from the Dagster UI at `http://localhost:4000`.

## Risk Boundary

Origo is research software. Data outputs are not investment advice, trading advice, execution simulation, regulatory approval, or a promise of future performance. Past performance is not predictive, and trading digital assets can result in total loss of capital.
