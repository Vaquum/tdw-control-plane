### Alternatives

<!-- List viable alternative approaches and how their impact, effort, and risk compare to this proposal (including any 80/20 options). -->

### Unresolved Questions

<!-- List the key open questions and known unknowns that could affect scope, design, or success. -->

### Success Metrics

<!-- Define how we will measure success, including key quantitative metrics and any critical qualitative outcomes. -->

### Business Release Date

<!-- Describe when this should ship and how that timing aligns with our roadmap and market expectations. -->

### Design

<!-- Provide an end-to-end overview of the solution — conceptual and, where relevant, technical — with links to key mocks, diagrams, and design docs. -->

### Work Phases

<!--
Break the work into a checkbox list under Non-coding and Coding, where each item is ≈1 mad-day of work or less.
Each coding item should eventually map to a single PR, forming a concrete, step-by-step execution plan
and progress tracker.
